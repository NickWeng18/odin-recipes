    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare all your ingredients before you begin. It is important to use mince from a cut of meat that has a little fat. This will not only add flavour, it also ensures a tender burger by preventing the patties from drying out during cooking. However, mince that is too fatty will expel the excess fat during cooking, causing the patties to shrink and toughen considerably. Topside is the recommended mince for making beef burgers as it contains the right amount of fat. Breadcrumbs] are not usually included in the traditional burger patty mixture, but their addition to this recipe helps to give the cooked patties a lighter, more tender texture. The egg acts as a binding ingredient so that the patties can be easily shaped. It also helps them hold together when cooked.</li>
        <li>Place the beef mince , breadcrumbs , egg , parsley , onion , garlic , Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce in large bowl. Season with salt and pepper . Mix with your hands until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions (you can use a 125ml / 1/2 cup measuring cup if you like). Shape each portion with your hands into a patty about: 10cm in diameter and 1.5cm thick.</li>
        <li>Place the patties onto a tray lined with- greaseproof paper. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to rest. Chilling the patties will help them hold together when cooked. This also allows the flavours in the patties to blend and develop. If you chill the patties for any longer, increase the cooking time slightly.</li>
        <li>Heat half the olive oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat and cook half the patties for about 4 minutes on each side or until browned and cooked through. It is important to cook mince right through because it has a larger ratio of surface area to volume than whole pieces of meat, and is therefore at greater risk of contamination by bacteria in the air. Transfer the patties to a plate, set aside and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining oil and patties.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat grill on high. Place the hamburger buns , cut-side up, under the preheated grill and toast for 1 minute or until golden, as desired. Leave the grill on. Place the patties on a baking tray lined with foil. Top patties with cheese . Place under the grill for 1 minute or until the cheese is just melted.</li>
        <li>To serve, spread the bottom halves of the toasted hamburger buns with the American mustard . Top with the lettuce , sliced tomato , patties and dollop with tomato sauce . Cover with the hamburger bun tops.</li>
    </ol>
